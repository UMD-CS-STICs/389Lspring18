Bederson is a Professor of Computer Science and prior director of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and iSchool at the University of Maryland. An ACM Distinguished Scientist, his research is on human computation, mobile device interfaces, interaction strategies, digital libraries, and digital education.  He is also Co-founder and Chief Scientist of Zumobi, a premium mobile app network.  He is well known for his work on Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs) since the mid-1990's including the Pad++ and Piccolo toolkits for zoomable and structured 2D graphics. That work led to his well known applications around personal photo management (PhotoMesa), calendaring (DateLens) and hierarchical data visualization (SpaceTree). ZUIs have since become well established in industry in a wide range of domains including maps and mobile phones. Ben is also well known for his work around children's educational technologies including his notable International Children's Digital Library (at www.childrenslibrary.org ).  More recently, Ben has established himself in the areas of human computation and online education. Human Computation is an approach to combine human with computational effort to solve problems at a scale and quality that neither could accomplish alone. One important example of this work is his NSF and Google supported work on MonoTrans, a system that enables monolingual human speakers to collaboratively translate text. Online education connects to human computation because one of the essential challenges is in scaling up individualized instruction and instructor connections to and awareness of class activity.

Hicks is a professor in the Computer Science Department and UMIACS at the University of Maryland, College Park. He received is Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in August 2001, and then spent one year as a post-doctoral associate affiliated with the Information Assurance Institute of the Computer Science Department at Cornell University. During academic year 2008 he spent his sabbatical in Cambridge, England visiting Microsoft Research and the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.  His research focuses on using programming languages and analyses to improve the security, reliability, and availability of software. Noteworthy among his research accomplishments is the development of analysis and compilation tools for enabling software to be safely updated without shutting it down. He has explored the design of new programming languages and analysis tools for automatically discovering or remediating software flaws and security vulnerabilities. He has also conducted studies on the utility of defect detection tools according on outcomes of human users, and explored distributed systems design and evaluation, particularly when adaptivity and security are system goals. Recently he has turned his attention to exploring means for securing remote and distributed computations among untrusted parties by combining cryptographic and programming language techniques.  During his career he has published more than 85 refereed conference and journal papers, many in highly selective venues. He won the ACM SIGPLAN Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2001, and an NSF CAREER award in 2003, and has three times won the Department of Computer Science's Faculty Teaching Award.

Biography  I am an MD and PhD (Computer Science) and have served as a professor of Computer Science & Medicine at Tel-Aviv University in the last 20 years, conducting multi-disciplinary research spanning a wide variety of topics. I have joined the University of Maryland in July 2014 as a CS professor and director of its center for bioinformatics and computational biology (CBCB). My research is focused on developing and harnessing computational systems biology approaches for the genomic analysis and genome scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) of cancer. My lab collaborates with several experimental cancer labs, aiming to utilize computational approaches to jointly gain a network-level integrative view of the systems we study, and predict and test novel drug targets and biomarkers to treat cancer more selectively and effectively. My lab has developed the first GSMM models of metabolism of different human tissues [1], identified the first GSMM-based synthetic lethal drug target to treat renal cancer [2], has been the first to identify synthetic lethal networks in cancer in a genome-wide manner [3], and together with our experimental collaborators, has recently identified the essential role of aspartate in ASS1-deficient tumors [4].  1.
