# Resources

AWS is extensive and can be very complex if you really dive into it. This class really only serves as an introduction, but if you enjoy it then I would recommend that you take a deeper dive. Feel free to come to me to chat about anything that you find!

I'll be tracking AWS-related resources in this document that I have found useful. Let me know if you have any recommendations.

- [AWS Open Guide](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws)
- [Cloud Architecture Patterns by Bill Wilder](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023777.do) (O'Reilly) [[PDF](https://github.com/sjarol/ebooks/blob/master/%5BCLOUD%5D%5BCloud%20Architecture%20Patterns%5D.pdf)]
- [AWS in Plain English](https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english)
- [All Things Distributed (Werner Vogels' Blog, CTO Amazon)](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/)
- [Jeff Bar's Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/)

If you want to continue to learn about AWS beyond what is covered in this class, I would also recommend the following courses:

- [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/): High-quality and frequently-updated (but paid) training for the various [AWS certifications](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/).
- UPenn's [NETS 212](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nets212/): Scalable and Cloud Computing
- CMU's [15-619](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~msakr/15619-s17/index.html): Online Cloud Computing course
